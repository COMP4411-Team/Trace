# Trace

* [x] 1W Implement an adaptive termination criterion for tracing rays.
  
* [x] 1W Implement antialiasing by supersampling and averaging down. This whistle upgrades to a bell if you implement the first stage of distribution ray tracing by jittering the sub-pixel samples.

* [x] 1B Implement spot lights.

* [ ] 1B Add a menu option that lets you specify a background image to replace the environment's ambient color during the rendering.

* [ ] 1B Find a good way to accelerate shadow attenuation.

* [ ] 1B Deal with overlapping objects intelligently.

* [ ] 1B1W Add texture mapping support to the program. Additional (variable) extra credit will be given for such additional mappings. Additional credit will be awarded for quality implementation of texture mapping on general trimeshes.

* [ ] 1B1W Implement antialiasing by adaptive supersampling.

* [ ] 1B1W Implement more versatile lighting controls.

* [ ] 2B Implement bump mapping.

* [ ] 2B Implement solid textures or some other form of procedural texture mapping.

* [ ] 2B Add some new types of geometry to the ray tracer.

* [ ] 2B Add support for height-fields.

* [ ] 2B Depth of field.

* [ ] 1B1W for each Soft shadows, motion blur, or glossy reflection.

* [ ] 3B Add some higher-level geometry to the ray tracer, such as surfaces of revolution, extrusions, metaballs or blend surfaces.

* [ ] 3B Implement ray-intersection optimization.

* [ ] 4B Implement a more realistic shading model (Fresnel term, microfacet distribution, anisotropic reflections, non photorealistic rendering).

* [ ] 4B Implement CSG.

* [ ] 4B Add a particle systems simulation and renderer.

* [ ] 4B Implement caustics.
