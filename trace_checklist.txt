Trace Bells and Whistles Checklist for Grading
(submit ONLY if you have implemented any B&Ws in the following)

################################################################
NOTE: Ray files and textures for b&w are under simpleSamples/bonus. Each bonus ray file contains comments about extension of .ray format.

NOTE: We provide multi-thread acceleration and you can enable it at main UI. It uses OpenMP shipped with VS so as long as you run the project with VS 2019 it should work. If not, make sure you enable support for OpenMP under Project Property->C/C++->Language->Open MP Support (it should already be enabled if you load our project).

All the bells and whistles are finished

W adaptive termination					yes - adjust threshold at main UI
W antialiasing by supersampling			yes - at main UI
+W jittering							yes
B spot lights							yes - see bonus/spotlight.ray
B background image						yes - see bonus/skybox.ray
B accelerate shadow atteuation			yes - enable at main UI
B overlapping tranparent objects		yes - see bonus/sphere_refract_overlapping.ray

BW texture mapping (diffuse and transparent)	
										yes - diffuse mapping: see bonus/diffuse_map.ray
+BW								  			  normal mapping: see bonus/normal_map.ray

BW antialiasing by adaptive supersampling	
										yes - enable at main UI (first enable Adaptive SS and render,
											then disable Adaptive SS and enable Visualize Adaptive SS to
											see the number of samples at each pixel, white indicates more
											samples)

BW Warn model							yes - see bonus/warnlight.ray, youcan change xmin and xmax to control flat map,
								        and p is the power number of warn model.
2B bump mapping							yes - see bonus/bump_map.ray
2B solid/procedural texture				yes - see bonus/perlin_noise.ray
2B new geometry (quadrics)				yes - see bonus/torus_knot.ray (definitely cooler than quadrics or 
											normal torus)
2B height fields						yes - first load height field map under File->load HFMap, then load
											bonus/blank.ray and render


For the following four, enabling multi-thread is recommended.

2B Depth of field 						yes - enable and adjust parameters at main UI
1.5B soft shadows 						yes - enable Distributed RT and load bonus/soft_shadow.ray
1.5B motion blur						yes - enable Motion Blur and load bonus/motion_blur.ray
1.5B glossy reflection					yes - enable Distributed RT and load bonus/glossy.ray

3B high lever geometry (e.g. metaballs)		
										yes, please load metaball.ray and render.

3B ray-intersection optimization		yes - we implemented bounding volumes hierarchy, although we did provide
											a switch to enable/disable it, you can verify it yourself by checking
											scene.h line 97-123 and scene.cpp line 308-EOF. Thank you :)

4B (varying) realistic shading model	yes - Fresnel term: see bonus/fresnel.ray
											  Beer's law: see bonus/beers_law.ray
											  GGX Microfacet BRDF: enable Distributed RT and load bonus/microfacet.ray
											  Anisotropic specular: see bonus/anisotropic_specular.ray

4B CSG									yes - see bonus/CSG.ray
4B Particle system						yes - see bonue/particle_system.ray

4B caustics								yes - first load bonus/caustics.ray, then click Build Photon Map and 
											enable Enable Photon Mapping, then click render
										NOTE: Please do NOT enable multi-thread for photon mapping

Extra (4-8B?): Path tracing				load bonus/cornell_box.ray or bonus/cornell_box2.ray, enable Enable Path
										tracing and then click Render PT. Recommend to use multi-thread.

										The path tracer is iterative, 64 iteration will usually give a satisfying result within reasonable amount of time. 5000+ iteration will usually be enough for rendering a noise-free image.
